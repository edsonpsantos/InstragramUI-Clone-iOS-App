# Instragram UI Clone iOS App

## 📱 About this project
This project refers to a UI Instagram clone by iOS Mobile.

I will build this frontend UI from scratch using Swift and SwiftUI with a MVVM architecture pattern. 

I will also adapt the app for iPad, Landscape, Dark Mode and a specific App Icon and a Launch screen to SwiftUI.

The repository contains all code based on an MVVM architecture with Swift and SwiftUI.

##  👨🏽‍💻 Technologies and Techniques used:
* Swift
* Swift UI
* MVVM Architecture stands for Model-View-ViewModel
  
   - The Model contains logic for the data layer.
  
   - The View contains logic for the app's UI.
  
   - The ViewModel contains the business logic for the app, connecting the View to the data (Models)!
* Good practices
